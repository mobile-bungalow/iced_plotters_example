# iced_plotters_was_a_mistake

at the moment this uses an upsetting amount of memory and has some graphical errors. But is otherwise fine.

This is a rudimentary, one file expirement implementing a plotters backend on top of iced (built with lyon).

It would likely be better if the rendering surface could adjust line and pixel size according to DPI.
