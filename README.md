# iced_plotters_example

This is a rudimentary, one file expirement implementing a plotters backend on top of iced (built with lyon).

There is some fudging neccesary to draw text correctly. And memory usage is large. but otherwise this seems okay.

# running the example code

```bash
cargo run --example candle_stick
```
